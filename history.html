            <p>Once a prosperous kingdom, Hallownest has been reduced to ruins, with the majority of its population dead, missing, or overcome by the Infection. At the surface stands the small village of Dirtmouth, whence the last of the civilised bugs were eventually drawn into the depths of the kingdom. Elderbug tells the tragic tale of the town and of the many adventurers before the player.</p>

            <p>Sometime in the past, an Old Light - the Radiance - ruled over a majority of the land with her loyal worshipers and creations, the Moths. However, another Pale Light appeared in the world, forming from the death of a powerful being known as a Wyrm. This new light adopted the title of The Pale King. He then founded the Kingdom of Hallownest and granted consciousness to those under the Radiance's rule. The bugs forsook the light that they had once obeyed and slowly forgot it. Even the Radiance's ardent tribe turned their backs on her in favour of this new ruler.</p>
